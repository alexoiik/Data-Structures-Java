# Data-Structures-Java
Includes some of the most familiar types of Data Structures in Java, created in NetBeans software. Also, contains some programs and apps that have been implemented with those data structures. These exercises/programs created during my department's semester at "Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms" course.

Except Data Structures, contains programs such as:
- Dice Rolling 
- Bracket Check App
- Car Queue Management  etc.
implemeted with data structures.
